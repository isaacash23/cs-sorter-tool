    <div id="survey">
        <p>The following questions are designed to help you understand the strengths and growth areas among your local government and community based on certain ”enabling conditions.” These enabling conditions reflect how readily a community can implement initiatives to promote <a href="https://www.bellpolicy.org/what-is-economic-mobility/">economic mobility</a>. The survey should take about 7-10 minutes to complete and you will be able to see your results after submitting.</p>
